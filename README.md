# ubi-blog

Ubiquitous blog repository that aims to provide uploading to different blogs, as well as being managed by a single code space.

## Description

There are many blogs out there, and there isn't a perfect blog space. So a lot of hopping occurs.
This repository attempts to store all blog posts in single repository while posting to all blog targets with the same posts.
